# Stock-Portfolio
This study aims to evaluate whether aggressive or defensive stocks provide superior riskadjusted returns for investors seeking to optimize their portfolios during the ongoing tariff wars. Considering the heightened market volatility caused by the implementation of reciprocal tariffs in April 2025, we also touched on identifying financial instruments that can help maximize riskreturn tradeoff for individual investors. 

## Research Methodology
To address this objective, we compared the Sharpe ratios of aggressive and defensive stock portfolios, using the portfolio with the higher ratio as the optimal risky portfolio, which is then combined with risk-free assets to form the complete portfolio.

## Stock Portfolio
### Aggressive Stocks
For the aggressive stocks, we selected from the technology sector due to their extensive global supply chains, significant import-export volumes, high sensitivity to cost fluctuations and market uncertainty, and strong reliance on innovation.

### Defensive Stocks
For defensive stocks, we chose stocks from customer staples industries, as these assets are characterized by diversified product offerings, stable and consistent consumer demand,and lower sensitivity to market volatility, particularly for necessities. Based on these considerations, we selected Apple, Microsoft, and NVIDIA for aggressive stocks and gold, Procter & Gamble, and Walmart for defensive stocks.

## Data Sources
We obtained stock performance data from Yahoo! Finance, covering 2022 to 2025, to capture the post-COVID, tariff war environment. To enhance the robustness of our approach, we conducted both two-asset and three-asset optimization models (the latter incorporating the S&P 500 as the market portfolio), with the objective of determining portfolio weights that accommodate varying levels of risk aversion. Ultimately, we assume that all investors will hold the same optimal risky portfolio, adjusting allocations between the risky and risk-free assets according to individual risk tolerance.
